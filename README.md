# Inspirational-Quote-CRUD
A fullstack Quotes app that incorporates CRUD functionality and allows users to add quotes of their favourite authors to the page. Users can add quotes by using the input field, delete quotes by clicking the bin icon and update quotes by clicking the heart icon. Each time a user likes the quote, the counter goes up by 1.
