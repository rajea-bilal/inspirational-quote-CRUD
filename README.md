# Inspirational-Quote-CRUD
A fullstack Quotes app that incorporates CRUD functionality and allows users to add quotes of their favourite authors to the page. Users can add quotes by using the input field, delete quotes by clicking the bin icon and update quotes by clicking on the heart icon. The counter goes up by 1, each time the user likes the quote.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node JS, EJS, MongoDB, Express

Full stack habit-tracking app built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Tailwind. Users can create new tasks, mark them complete and delete them. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

- Add authentication to the app so users can create their own personalised accounts and be able to track their tasks individually.
- Build a search function that will bring tasks from a particular date in the past.
- Feature an inspirational quote that changes every day.

## Lessons Learned:

- I learnt Tailwind for this project so I would consider that the biggest takeaway.
- Finally, understand how a simple CRUD app works behind the scenes and how bigger applications are just bigger lego blocks put together.
- Gave me the confidence to build again :)
